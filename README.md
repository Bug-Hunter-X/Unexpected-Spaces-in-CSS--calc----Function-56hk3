# Unexpected Spaces in CSS `calc()` Function

This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in CSS: unexpected spaces within the `calc()` function.  Incorrect spacing around the plus (+) or minus (-) operators can cause the calculation to fail or produce unexpected results.

## Bug

The `bug.css` file contains CSS that uses the `calc()` function with extra spaces around the minus operator.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file shows the corrected CSS with the proper syntax, removing any spaces around the operators within the `calc()` function.
